#!/usr/bin/env bash
# wire-agent-dispatch.sh -- point /srv/agent's four files at this clone, so a
# merged PR reaches the 01:00 nightly instead of a copy nothing refreshes.
# TRAPS (the rest of this header is in the vault):
# `/srv/agent` is not a git repository (#1332). Its files were placed by hand
# and versioned afterwards, so `main` and the host agree by coincidence rather
# than by any path, and stop agreeing on the next merge. The clone this runs from is
# already pulled every 20 minutes by the `realisateur:estate-watch:WATCH` cron
# row, so a symlink is the whole propagation mechanism -- no second pull, no
# copy step, no deploy tree.
#
# WHY SYMLINKS AND NOT `cp`: a copy has to be re-copied, which is the thing
# that never happens. `nightly.sh` resolves its siblings with
# `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"`, which is the SYMLINK's directory, so the logs,
# `.nightly.lock` and `work/` stay in /srv/agent where they belong.
#
# BEHIND IS NOT DRIFT, and conflating them makes this verb useless the first
# time it is needed: the host copy differing from `main` is the NORMAL state
# after a merge. `git hash-object` the host's bytes and ask whether that blob
# was ever this path's content -- if it was, the host is simply behind and the
# clone is authoritative. If it never was, somebody edited the host, and THAT
# is refused with the diff named rather than overwritten.
