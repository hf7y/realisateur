# GUARD: does this diff add more prose than mechanism?
# RUNNER: .github/workflows/tests.yml
# GUARD-TEST: bin/tests/markdown-cost.test.sh
# GATE: none -- its range is a merge-base against origin/main, which a fixture repo with no origin cannot form; its suite builds a throwaway repo per case instead
# VERIFIED: 2026-08-15 via bash bin/markdown-cost.sh, bash bin/markdown-cost.sh --census, and bash bin/tests/markdown-cost.test.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-06 this ecosystem merged 26 pull requests and
# filed 42 issues, and a large share of the output was prose describing its own
# condition rather than mechanism that does anything. Zach, the same day:
# "Description needs a cost. Markdown needs a cost." Nothing measured that, so
# nothing resisted it -- a branch could be 90% new .md and pass every gate in
# bin/, because every gate in bin/ was built to catch a script that lies, not a
# document that merely exists.
#
# WHAT IT PRICES. Four things. The first three are over ADDED lines only
# (deletions are free -- reaping prose is the behaviour we want, not the one we
# tax); the fourth measures the tree instead of the diff:
#
#   1. THE RATIO. markdown-added / total-added. Over the threshold (default
#      30%, MARKDOWN_COST_MAX_PCT) the run exits 1 and names the ratio and
#      every file that contributed to the numerator. This is not a style
#      opinion; it is the one number that separates "a change, documented"
#      from "a document, with a change attached".
#
#   2. A NEW TOP-LEVEL *.md FILE. Editing an existing document is how a
#      record stays current. ADDING another one at the repository root is how
#      this repository got 40-odd of them, most written once and read never
#      (see PROSE-REAPING.md, which is itself one of them). Any new root .md
#      outside the allowlist exits 1 on its own, whatever the ratio says.
#
#   3. COMMENTS IN FILES THAT ARE NOT MARKDOWN -- most of the estate's prose.
#      Flags at >=150 added comment lines AND >=60% of added non-markdown.
#
#   4. THE TREE, AGAINST A RATCHET (--census). bin/markdown-cost.ratchet
#      records the tree's prose count; it only ever falls.
#
# THE ONE BUG IT MUST NOT HAVE. In this ecosystem "found nothing" has
# repeatedly been reported as "nothing is wrong" -- a survey that reached zero
# projects printing a tidy summary and exiting 0 (see bin/lib/conf.sh's header
# for the propagation case that reached NOBODY). So every path here that cannot
# resolve the range, cannot read the diff, or cannot classify a file exits 2 and
# says which. Exit 0 from this script means one specific thing: the diff was
# read, the added lines were counted, and the count came in under the price.
# It never means the script could not tell.
#
# Usage:
#   markdown-cost.sh                 price $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)..HEAD
#   markdown-cost.sh <range>         price an explicit range, e.g. main..HEAD
#   MARKDOWN_COST_MAX_PCT=50 markdown-cost.sh
