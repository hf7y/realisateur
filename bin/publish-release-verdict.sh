#!/usr/bin/env bash
# publish-release-verdict.sh -- publish tonight's release verdict to ONE
# public URL that every consumer reads live.
#
# TRAPS (the rest of this header is in the vault):
#
# WHY A URL, NOT A FILE IN A REPO. A verdict committed into `hf7y/verbs` is
# read out of a consumer's CLONE, and a stale clone is the bug being fixed.
# One live endpoint, no local copy to rot: hf7y.com/verbs/status.json.
#
# WHY THIS ENDPOINT. A uid-3000 account's credential grants read on its OWN
# repo only, so the verdict must be readable with NO credential or the
# consumers that need it most cannot see it. Disclosed, deliberately: project
# names, short SHAs, run and build ids for private repos -- no code, no
# diffs, no paths, no credentials.
#
# IT MUST RUN ON NIGHTS THAT PRODUCE NOTHING, or "nothing changed" and "main
# is broken" are again the same absence. `if: always()`, and the decision is
# a closed enum -- CUT | NO_CHANGE | BLOCKED | ERROR -- refused here AND on
# the consumer, so "unrecognised" never means "probably fine".
#
# THE CHANNEL'S FAILURE MODE IS SILENCE, AND SILENCE RENDERS AS THE LAST GOOD
# VERDICT. That is guard-estate's "BLIND must not grade as CLEAN" applied to
# a channel. The fix is NOT a tighter staleness window: a nightly emitter
# legitimately looks 0-24h old, so 26h is the FLOOR a nightly cadence
# imposes, not slack. Instead, (1) the producer writes `valid_until` from its
# own cadence, so one number moves both halves, and a consumer past it grades
# BAD whatever the decision says; (2) build-verbs.yml re-invokes this with a
# MINIMAL argv on failure, recovering the case where the logic was right and
# the argument vector was fatal. Neither covers the other: (1) misses a
# publisher failing inside its cadence, (2) misses a workflow that never ran.
