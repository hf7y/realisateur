"""Collect the estate's health AS ITS CONTAINERS REPORT IT.

RUN ON dexter:  python3 estate-status-collect.py
Read-only: reads `docker inspect`, /srv/*/compose.yaml, this account's crontab
and the nightly agent logs under /srv/agent. Writes nothing, starts nothing,
dispatches nothing. Prints one JSON document on stdout -- the payload published
to https://hf7y.com/estate/status.json by bin/estate-watch.sh.

WHY CONTAINERS ARE THE SUBJECT. The unix accounts this replaces are gone with
monkey (2026-09-24). What runs the estate now is two kinds of container, and
they fail differently:

  SERVICES   long-lived, one per /srv/<name>/compose.yaml. Their failure is
             silent: roster sat Exited for four days with RestartCount 0
             because `restart: always` does not cover a container that fails
             at START (realisateur#1191).
  PASSES     one --rm container per repo per night, spawned by /srv/agent.
             Their failure is also silent -- the pass "finishes" and the work
             is simply absent -- so a pass is graded on what it LEFT, not on
             its exit code alone.

Every field is a probe of live state at generation time. A field this script
cannot read is null, never a guess or a zero: a missing log means the repo has
never been dispatched, which is a finding, not a blank.
