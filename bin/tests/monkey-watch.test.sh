# SUBJECT: bin/monkey-watch.sh -- the only observer OUTSIDE the system it
# observes, and the invoker of the dashboard Zach reads.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS, 2026-08-22. realisateur#511's reachability scan read
# .github/workflows/ and this repo's bin/, found no caller for monkey-watch.sh,
# and deleted it. Its caller was a CRONTAB LINE ON ANOTHER MACHINE -- dexter,
# every ten minutes, out of a checkout dexter pulls itself.
# The blast radius was not one script: #511 protected the
# dashboard payload BY NAME while the same PR deleted its only invoker, keeping
# the payload and cutting its clock (#518); #524 then deleted the merge lib as
# an orphan. Dexter's cron kept firing into a deleted path, appending
# `not found` to a 47 MB log -- a fault indicator nobody reads.
#
# So: the observer exists, names the parts it needs, those parts exist -- and
# THE DASHBOARD PAYLOAD HAS AN INVOKER, which is the guard.
