# THE CONTRACT, in one place. MOVED 2026-09-03 (Zach): deploy-drift and
# comment-claims are now REQUIRED. The old reading called them advisory because
# "a third party could wedge every PR here" -- but deploy-drift's subject is
# hf7y/verbs, which is this estate's own repo, not a third party, and its red
# means the deployed workflow diverged from the source (#645, which cost a
# night of silent no-op cuts). Zach: "whatever breaks, we should fix it anyway."
# So a red one blocks a merge until the drift is fixed, which is the work
# either way.
