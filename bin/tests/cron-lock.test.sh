# SUBJECT: bin/lib/cron-lock.sh -- the guard that stops a clock from stacking.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS, 2026-08-25. monkey-watch.sh ran from dexter's crontab
# every ten minutes with ConnectTimeout and no lock. monkey wedged mid-auth --
# TCP up, banner sent, never authenticated -- so ConnectTimeout, which bounds
# the CONNECT and not the session, expired on nothing. Every run hung, one per
# tick, nine of them before a human looked. The two other clocks in this repo
# had the same shape and had simply not been unlucky yet.
#
# So: B is the ratchet. A script that declares a cron cadence declares
# CRON_TAG, and this suite fails if such a script does not take the lock --
# which makes the next clock arrive locked instead of arriving hopeful.
#
# HERMETICITY: no network, no ssh, no crontab. A only flocks a file in $T;
# B greps the tree.
