# THE MAIN SIDE IS origin/main, NOT HEAD -- changed 2026-08-23, hf7y/realisateur#578.
#
# It was HEAD, on the reasoning that "a PR that edits a carried source without
# carrying it goes red before it merges". That is incompatible with how this
# estate actually carries, and bin/lib/carries.tsv records why: carrying BEFORE
# the merge is what put a #510 change onto bashified before that PR landed, 25
# minutes before #511 deleted its premise. The carry is a SECOND STEP, AFTER
# the merge -- so under the old rule every branch touching a carried source was
# red for doing the right thing.
#
# MEASURED, and it was not theoretical: `suites` is a REQUIRED check, so this
# suite wedged every such PR. On 2026-08-23 that was #565, #571 and #579 at
# once -- three PRs that could never merge, one of them not even ours.
#
# origin/main answers the question this guard was built for (#516): is the
# CARRY behind, or has bashified been hand-edited? A PR cannot fail that, and
# a missing carry still goes red the moment it merges.
# THE TABLE COMES FROM origin/main TOO, not the working tree. Reading it from
# the branch reintroduced the same wedge one line down: a PR that ADDS a row
# (bin/lib/answered.jq, #571) asks "is this carried yet?" about a file main has
# never shipped, and the honest answer -- not yet -- was a red required check.
# Found by checking #571's log instead of assuming the first fix covered it.
