#
# TRAPS (the rest of this header is in the vault):
# WHY `current` IS A SYMLINK AND THE ~/.local/bin LINKS ARE WRITTEN ONCE
# Adopting a build, or rolling back, repoints ONE symlink -- so the verb
# set changes all at once or not at all. N independent `git pull`s cannot
# express that: they half-succeed, and leave you running a verb set that
# never existed as a whole and cannot be named in a bug report.
# And it never reports "you are up to date" when it could not look. An
# unreachable remote is BLIND, exit 6: skipping unreachable destinations makes
# "nothing pending" indistinguishable from "everything is proven".
