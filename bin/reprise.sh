# NOT A VERB, deliberately (bin/lib/not-a-verb.tsv's test, Zach 2026-08-11:
# "would another agent or Zach ever call one of those?"). Nobody types
# `reprise`; ausculte reports the row and --apply opens its own PR. It is LOCAL
# in bin/lib/propagation-set.sh -- it acts on THIS repo's handoff table, so
# shipping it to twelve accounts would give each one a tool with nothing to do.
# RUNNER: bin/ausculte.sh (the `handoff` probe), on ausculte-cadence's clock
# GUARD-TEST: bin/tests/reprise.test.sh
# GATE: none -- `--check` reports and `--apply` opens a PR a human merges. It
#   deletes nothing that is not already present at its destination, so there is
#   no invocation of this that can gate a build or block a branch.
#
# TRAP: a MERGED pr is not a delivery. The witness is the file's presence on
#   the receiving repo's DEFAULT BRANCH; merged-but-absent is a failure that
#   deletes nothing, because #368's rule is that a file removed here before it
#   exists there is an outage.
# TRAP: it never pushes `main` (CLAUDE.md) -- --apply builds a branch and a PR.
