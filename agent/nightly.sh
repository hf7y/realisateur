#!/usr/bin/env bash
# nightly.sh -- spawn one agent container per repo, in order, one at a time.
# This is the whole overnight scheduler. There is no pacer, no rotation index,
# no usage gate, no ledger and no ROSTER; the file next to this one is the list
# and `flock` is the concurrency control.
#
# What replaced what:
#   usage-paced-runner.sh 1365 lines  ->  this loop
#   sweep-loop-common.sh  1024 lines  ->  run-agent.sh's docker run
#   usage-gate.sh          409 lines  ->  nothing. A 429 fails one repo's pass
#                                         and the loop moves on. A coordinator
#                                         traded for a retry, deliberately.
