#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-agent.sh <repo> [max_turns] -- one unattended pass over a repo's open
# issues, in a container. This is the whole dispatch mechanism: no ROSTER, no
# pacer, no rotation index, no ledger, no flock, no unix account.
#
# THE FLAG THAT MAKES IT UNATTENDED, and it took four runs to find:
#
#   --permission-mode acceptEdits   allows EDITS, still PROMPTS on Bash
#   --allowedTools "Bash,..."       what actually runs unattended
#
# With acceptEdits, `gh`, `curl`, `git fetch`, python urllib and even `ping` all
# came back "This command requires approval" -- and an unattended run has no
# approver. The agent diagnosed that correctly, stopped probing and wrote an
# honest report; the configuration was the bug.
#
# The string below is not invented. It is hf7y/scheduler
# lib/sweep-loop-common.sh:59, the default behind 5,155 DONE runs:
#   : "${ALLOWED_TOOLS:=Bash,Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep}"
#
# `Bash` unqualified grants network. The containment is the CONTAINER -- --rm,
# --cpus, --memory, and no host mount but the two credential files -- not a
# tool allow-list. That replaces `run_contained`'s systemd-run scope, and with
# it the 1,024-line file that held it.
#
# Credentials are MOUNTED read-only, never env vars on a command line, so they
# stay out of `docker inspect`, `ps` and shell history.

You are working unattended on hf7y-estate/${repo}. ONE issue, ONE branch, then stop.

\`gh\` is authenticated and the network works. Start by reading the queue:

    gh issue list --repo hf7y-estate/${repo} --state open \\
      --search '-label:needs-host -label:needs-human'

Those two exclusions ARE the queue, not a suggestion. \`needs-host\` means the
issue cannot be finished from here -- it needs a physical device or a live
remote host. Do not route around the filter by listing issues without it.

Then:
1. Pick the ONE you can finish AND verify from this container: network, node,
   git, gh, a shell, this checkout. Prefer small and provable over interesting.
   Spend at most a few turns choosing. Choosing is not the work.
2. Branch. Make the change. Run whatever test covers it and show its real
   output. Commit.
3. Push the branch and open a PR with \`gh pr create\`. Never push to main.
   End the body with both blocks below, verbatim markers -- they are what lets a
   checker grade the claim afterwards instead of only reading it. Write
   \`- none\` in either one when it is empty, and note that DELIVERS entries are
   \`path:X\` with no space:

       <!-- DEFERRED -->
       - none
       <!-- /DEFERRED -->

       <!-- DELIVERS -->
       - path:<file> -- what takes effect outside the repo when this lands
       <!-- /DELIVERS -->
4. Write REPORT.md in the repo root before you finish, WHATEVER happened: the
   issue number, the branch, the test command and its actual output, the PR
   URL, and anything you could not do. Leave it untracked, do not commit it.
   If you achieved nothing, say so plainly and say why -- "nothing finishable
   from here, because X" is a SUCCESSFUL run of this mechanism. A silent or
   empty report is the only real failure.

State the command behind every claim you make about what the code does.

The agent exited without writing a report, so this says only what the harness
can see from outside the container. It is NOT a verdict on the pass: rc 0, a
clean tree and turns well under the cap is an orderly exit that landed nothing,
which the brief calls a successful run. rc non-zero or a dirty tree is not.
