Current focus: process whatever's sitting in the inbox (repo root artifacts
not yet archived — see `.claude/commands/nightly-batch.md` step 1 for how
to tell) and turn each viable idea into a real, scaffolded project wired
into the scheduler ecosystem the same way realisateur itself is.

realisateur has no web tracker (like `crt`), so there is no
`NIGHTLY:`-flagged-report convention here — scope is purely this file plus
whatever's physically sitting in the inbox.

**Policy: build maximally autonomously.**

- Pick the most reasonable interpretation of a dropped artifact and act on
  it — scaffold the project, don't just write up what it might be.
- A new project gets its own directory under `~/Documents/Projects/`, its
  own git repo, and (if it's an agent/codebase project that would benefit
  from unattended iteration) its own scheduler registration, following
  exactly the process `SCHEDULER.md` documents for realisateur itself.
- Archive the source artifact once acted on (or once a real decision was
  made not to act on it) so it's not re-processed next time.
- Flag what got built and why in `.claude/QUESTIONS.md` and in the report
  — the flag IS the review point, not a request to build.
- **The only real stop-and-wait bar: something that can't be reverted.** A
  commit, a branch, a new scheduler registration, a local bare git remote
  — none of these block you. What does: a real message to a person outside
  this loop, spending real money, deleting something with no backup, or
  registering against a REAL GitHub remote with credentials that could leak
  (prefer a local bare remote per `SCHEDULER.md` unless a GitHub remote is
  clearly already the right call). If genuinely unsure, that's the
  `.claude/QUESTIONS.md` case — but err toward "revertible, proceed."
